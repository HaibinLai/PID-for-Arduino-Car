md__r_e_a_d_m_e \- PID Line Following Algorithm for Arduino-based Car 
.PP
 When designing an Arduino-based car, the PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) line following algorithm is an effective control method that ensures the car travels steadily along a predefined path\&. Here's a brief overview of this algorithm:
.SH "PID Algorithm Overview"
.PP
The PID controller relies on three main parameters: Proportional (P), Integral (I), and Derivative (D)\&. These parameters are adjusted to precisely guide the car based on sensor-detected track positions:
.PP
\fBProportional (P)\fP: Adjusts the control output based on the current error, allowing the car to approach the center of the track more rapidly\&.
.PP
\fBIntegral (I)\fP: Corrects long-term deviations by accumulating historical errors, ensuring the system maintains stability over extended periods\&.
.PP
\fBDerivative (D)\fP: Predicts error rate changes to prevent overshooting or oscillations, achieving smooth track tracking\&.

.SH "Arduino Introduction"
.PP
Arduino is an open-source electronics prototyping platform that provides accessible hardware and software tools for creating interactive projects\&. Its components include:
.PP
Development Boards: Mainboards based on microcontrollers like Arduino UNO, Arduino Mega, etc\&.
.PP
Integrated Development Environment (IDE): Software tool used for writing and uploading code to Arduino boards\&.
.PP
Library Functions: Pre-built function libraries that simplify control from sensors to actuators\&.
.PP
.SH "Conclusion"
.PP
The PID line following algorithm harnesses the flexibility and user-friendliness of Arduino, making the design and debugging of Arduino-based cars efficient and effective\&. By fine-tuning PID parameters, stable navigation along complex tracks can be achieved, empowering robotics control and automation projects\&.
.PP
This approach not only offers theoretical advantages but also practical applications that leverage Arduino's dynamics effectively\&.
